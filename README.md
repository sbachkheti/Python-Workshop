# Python_Workshop

**April 2019 Python Workshop and Introduction**

The aim of the day is to introduce those unfamiliar with the Python ecosystem to the platform. This is a first time workshop so hopefully I and others will demonstrate the strengths of the core libraries and point you in the right direction when it comes to scientific computing with Python. This is an introductory level interactive workshop with a focus at the end on some key libraries for geoscience. 

All going well we will follow this up with an interactive BYOP (bring your own project) session in the following weeks where you can get help or help others in Python.

## What to bring:
If you have a laptop I recommend you bring it and your charger along. This way Python will be setup wherever you go. Otherwise, we are in the PC lab so you can just log on to a local machine if you prefer.

## Python Introduction:
1. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and the [Python](https://www.python.org/) scientific ecosystem.
  - Installing Anaconda and running Python.
  - Installing key libraries and IDEs.
